# move-planner
Using APIs and AJAX to generate a website presenting information about an address. This project was completed as part of the Udacity Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree.

## Quickstart
To view the website, fork the respository, then clone it to your local machine. Opening index.html in a browser will display the form that prompts for an address. Submitting an address will perform the streetview and API requests, which will then be loaded asynchronously using AJAX.
